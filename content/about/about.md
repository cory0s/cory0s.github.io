### My Background

I'm a Washington native and University of Washington graduate. I worked for several years as an engineer designing buildings before discovering the exciting world of coding via the internet whilst spending some time overseas. I fell in love with the fact that you can build BIG, AWESOME things...without cranes...and concrete and welding torches and safety equipment and etc. Don't get me wrong, my old job was fun, but I'm drawn to the idea of the flexibility software provides. As developers we can work with people anywhere in the world, on amazing projects, with nothing but a laptop. And I think that's pretty neat. I'm excited to see where this takes me!

### Things I Enjoy

* I love going on outdoor adventures, especially via bicycle.
* I read too much fiction.
* Korean food > pizza + tacos
* I'm at SBP a lot...say hi if you see me!
